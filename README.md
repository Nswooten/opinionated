# Opinionated

## Objective:
For this project, I was tasked with building a full-stack apllication from sratch while utilizing the MEN stack. I chose to build an application where the user can add their opinion and rating to a specific media type. The user can also view other user's opinions and ratings. 

## Motivation:

I consider my entire family quite opinionated. We all enjoy sharing media recommendations with each other. Logically, when deciding what application to create, Opinionated was born. I thought it would be really cool to have a place where we could all log-on, add our newest media, and leave an opinion for the rest of the family to enjoy.
